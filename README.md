# Night_School

The purpose of this project is to create a web application for a Night School. A user can register as a Teacher or a Student. User has to enter some details while registering to this web application. For example, if user wants to register as a teacher, he/she has to enter their education level and subjects they have expertise in. As for students, they will have to enter details like age, their day jobs etc. The details can be stored and viewed through SQL Database. Each student can have just one teacher but a teacher can be assigned with multiple students. Students can be added or removed. Teachers will be having access to details of the students assigned to them. This is a simple Web 2.0 application which provides a way to connect these teachers and students with necessary information shared between them in a secured manner.
